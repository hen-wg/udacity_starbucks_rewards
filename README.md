# Getting Started
This project uses remote development through [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) , or running natively from Windows. The environment is controlled using `venv` and `pip` for package management.

## Installation process
In order to get the project up and running, open a terminal window and run the following commands:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing
Testing and code modularization was beyond the scope of this tutorial but may be included for future work.
